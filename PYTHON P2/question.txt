We are going to write a program that generates a rndom number and sk the user to guess it.
if the player's guess is higher than the actual number , the program displays "lower number please". Similarly if the user's guess is too low, the program prints "highrt number please" When the user gueesses the correct number , the program diplays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

Hint: Use the random module.
